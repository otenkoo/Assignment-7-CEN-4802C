This two-week project represents a culmination of the concepts and tools that we have been working with throughout the semester.
Your task is to implement, document, and demonstrate a workflow / pipeline that includes at minimum the following practices: 

  -Code development (Eclipse)
  
  -Distributed version control (GitHub)
  
  -Unit testing (JUnit)
  
  -Build automation (Maven)
  
  -Continuous integration / continuous delivery (Jenkins)
