This two-week project represents a culmination of the concepts and tools that we have been working with throughout the semester.
Your task is to implement, document, and demonstrate a workflow / pipeline that includes at minimum the following practices: 

  -Code development (Eclipse)
  -Distributed version control (GitHub)
  -Unit testing (JUnit)
  -Build automation (Maven)
  -Continuous integration / continuous delivery (Jenkins)
  -Container / virtual machine export (Docker)
  
Recommended tools are noted in parentheses alongside each concept. You are free to use other tools with similar functionality in your workflow if they work better for you.
